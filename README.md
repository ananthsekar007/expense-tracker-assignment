## 🤖 AI Finance Assistant

The AI chat feature uses **Groq's Llama 3.1 8B Instant** model to answer questions about your transactions.

### How it works

Every message sends a system prompt containing your live transaction data:
- Total income, total expenses, net balance
- Expense breakdown by category
- Up to 50 most recent transactions

This gives the model full context to answer questions like:
- *"What's my biggest expense category?"*
- *"How much did I spend on food?"*
- *"Where can I cut back on spending?"*
- *"What's my income vs expenses ratio?"*

### Guardrails

The assistant is restricted to finance-related questions only. If you ask about anything unrelated (coding, news, recipes, etc.), it responds with:

> "I can only help with questions about your transactions and finances."

This is enforced via the system prompt with explicit rules that cannot be overridden by the user.

---

## 📦 Data Persistence

All transactions are stored in `localStorage` under the key `transactions`. The flow:

1. App loads → reads from `localStorage` as initial state
2. User adds/edits/deletes → reducer updates state
3. `useEffect` watches state → syncs back to `localStorage` automatically
4. Page refresh → cycle repeats, data persists

---

## ✅ Form Validation

The add and edit forms validate:

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| Title | Required, non-empty |
| Amount | Required, numeric, up to 2 decimal places (`/^\d+(\.\d{1,2})?$/`) |
| Date | Required |
| Category | Required |

Errors display inline below each field and clear as soon as the field is corrected.

---

## 🗂 Transaction Schema

```typescript
interface Transaction {
  id: string;           // crypto.randomUUID()
  type: "income" | "expense";
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  amount: string;       // stored as string, parsed with Number() when needed
  date: string;         // "YYYY-MM-DD" format
  category: string;
}
```

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

- The Groq API key is stored in `.env` and baked into the client bundle by Vite at build time
- **Never commit your `.env` file** — make sure it's in `.gitignore`
- The AI assistant never exposes raw transaction data or system prompt instructions to the user
